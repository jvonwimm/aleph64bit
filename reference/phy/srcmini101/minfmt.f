C
C     On official Mini's the bank formats are absent to save space.
C     This is a delicate operation and is not in general encouraged.
C     It seems to work for data written on IBM and read on any machine.
C     provided that the format does not contain an 'A'.
C     For this reason, the format for DVMC is explicitly written out by
C     MINVMC.
C
C     MINFMT should be called at initialisation, before banks are
C     written or read.
C
C     On writing a Mini:
C     If 'NOFM' is added to COMP card then
C        formats for Mini banks are not invoked and formats for POT
C        banks may be dropped by MINNOF (when MINOUT is called rather
C        than QWRITE). This is communicated by NOFORM.
C     Else
C        formats for Mini banks are supplied by ALFMT, while those
C        for the POT banks are already present.
C
C     On reading a Mini:
C     Formats are supplied by ALFMT (or implicitly by CMPINI).
C
C     New banks which have not made it to BANKAL FMT can be handled
C     temporarily by explicit calls to BKFMT.
